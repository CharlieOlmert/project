The Harvard Men's Lacrosse Team wants to identify and gain every advantage that it can possible have over its opponents, and I am looking into the data behind where and when we shoot the ball to find a new edge for the upcoming season.

Lacrosse, like many sports, is filled with many clich√©s about where on the field and when in a possession a "good" shot is likely to occur (often said to be in the middle of the field and later in possessions), but there remains shockingly little data behind such claims. Very few if any NCAA lacrosse teams use shot location data to analyze their offenses, so this data and analysis is truly at the cutting-edge of the sport. Furthermore, NCAA men's lacrosse is adding an 80-second shot clock for the upcoming season, so the analysis of the data on when and where our offense took shots last year serves a forward-looking purpose, for, just by looking at a few graphs, our team can now understand how much our offense will need to adjust our strategy for the 2019 spring season. Finally, the coaches and I plan to use the code from this project to analyze shooting data for the upcoming season too.

For further reading about the latest on data in the sport and the upcoming shot clock, I will attach a few links below. Patrick McEwen, whose informative twitter handle is @LaxFilmRoom, is really at the forefront of using data and numbers to further understand the sport. Here is a comprehensive article he wrote for InsideLacrosse.com about the Cornell offense in which there is a lot of solid analysis and clips to help understand the sport and particularly offense: https://www.insidelacrosse.com/article/lax-film-room-why-cornell-s-offense-is-deadlier-than-you-think/51904. And here is a link to a website McEwen ran last year that keeps track of analytical measurements for each NCAA D1 team http://analyticslacrosse.com/d1men/2018/teams. And, finally, here is a very explanatory InsideLacrosse.com article about the shot clock coming to NCAA men's lacrosse in 2019: https://www.insidelacrosse.com/article/ncaa-rules-committee-changes-shot-clock-proposal-after-coach-feedback/53063.
