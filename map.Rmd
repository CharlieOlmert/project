# A large part of the work I did on this project is contained neither in this .Rmd file nor the app.R
# file. This pre-coding work was the time I spent collecting the shot data â€” about 10 hours. This
# took so long because I had to go back through all six of the Ivy League games from last season and
# log the location of each shot in yards in the y-direction and x-direction from the goal and the
# player who took that shot. I then had to convert those yards to pixels based on the dimensions of
# the image I used to show the offensive end of the field. Once this data collection and conversion
# was completed, then I began the coding seen here and in the app.R file.

# Comprehensive and clean shot statistics from all Ivy League games. Film from the Princeton game was
# cut off.
